        <h2>Hellooo <br>Haeee &#128514</h2>
         I wish I really knew how to code like those proffessionals .. I'd create an amazing site full of weird stuff. Alafu this thing doesn't have autocorrect <br>
            so if you see some mistakes just ignore them &#128514<br>
            Kitambo I used to like editing.. so I think I'll make an edit of you. But sasa I don't have many videos of you.. and I don't have a good app for it and I feel really lazy <br>
            Wacha I'll ask you for the videos after I find an app and an idea for the song. Might take a few weeks &#128514<br>
            But knowing you you probably won't send me the videos &#128514 ukikataa I'll just use the ones I have and leave a couple of blanks &#128514&#128514<br>

        <p id="p1">
            I finally found a song (or rather..a sound) for the edit .. but ni ya anime I'm not sure you'll like it &#128514<br>
            but I can't find a premium version of capcut to download.. I guess I'll just have to use the free and borring effects &#128557<br>
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            Nilijua tu you'll make me beg for the videos &#128557 <br>
            But it's done.. Don't compare it to the edits you see in tiktok &#128557 and I hope you'll like it<br>
            It's not that long though <br><br>
            <table>

        So Tomorrow's your birthday &#128578<br>
        But I guess you're still not excited about it.. I hoped all this would change your mind but I don't know<br>
        <pre>I'm really sorry for ruining things 
I just felt like you'd be better off without worrying about if you're doing stuff that'll hurt me 
but I should've asked you about it or told you what I was thinking Kitambo
Just try to have fun today .. maybe with your family ama maybe you'd prefer having fun alone coz you're an "Introvert" &#128514
I don't know what'll happen between us but I wasn't asking for a permanent breakup. I mean it got to a point where I started thinking
about how it would be if we got married. But then I remember that you're older than me and maybe you'd like someone older &#128514
plus I didn't fit the qualities of your dream guy..the ones you listed for me kitambo
But who knows what will happen.. I mean I wouldn't mind marrying you &#128578
I'm willing to forget all the bad things that have happened between us coz I feel like the reason I overthink too much 
is because I keep remembering the bad stuff. I don't know why some of the good stuff don't come to mind 
like the fact that you left someone you really liked for me or that you didn't leave me after knowing about my issues
and I'm sure if i forget all that stuff I'll be able to trust you the same way I did back then.. But I still trust you alot
I mean I'm trusting you with my life with this &#128557 If you send this to any of my friends my life will be over &#128557&#128557
Lakini even with all my overthinking I dont doubted your love for me. and I'm sure you dont doubt me.. 
I know you said you never feel loved coz of your past trauma and nothing i say will change that .. but maybe this will change that &#128557 idk
or maybe it'll change the day I propose &#128578 
        </pre><br>
        Anyway.. I think i'm done yapping through text &#128514<br>
        Idk if i should say I love you... do friends tell eachother that &#128514<br>
        Happy birthday Winnie &#128578<br>
        I love you &#128578&#128578<br>
