        <p> Its May 10th.. I finished my stressful exams.. and i thought designing this site would help me with my html exam &#128557 (I was wrong)<br>
            like 80 % of the exam was theory .. ata haimake sense si as long as i know how to code.. who cares about the characteristics of a good website<BR>
            ANYWAY... Happy birthday Winnie &#128514 <br>
            Damn You're 20 now.. Don't you feel weird dating someone so young &#128514 I mean you're more experienced then me when it comes to a lot of stuff<br>
            Including dating.. i feel weird about it sometimes. but oh well I'm guessing there's somethingyou see in me that I don't see in myself &#128514<br>
            I still don't know what to get you for your birthday<br>
            For some reason I feel like you won't like a bottle of water.. maybe I'll get you some fruits.. ama I can give you a hug &#128578<br>
            We'll just see<br>
            Maybe I should just list some of the songs that remind me of you in this page .. apart from Khalid songs and the songs from our playlist<br>
            I don't know if you remember this song I told you about kitambo.. back when I was living alone. I'll place a spotify link on the image coz putting the song the other way might complicate things &#128514<br><br><br>
            
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/50x1Ic8CaXkYNvjmxe3WXy?si=B-G4FYHeQrqghHUGDXPERA " target="_blank"><img src="Those eyes.jpg" alt="Those eyes" width="200px"></a><br><br>
            Come to think of it I'm not as obsessed as I was back then &#128514 labda I'm improving...<br>
            Then there's this song that's kinda like a post breakup song but It makes me think of you.. sijui mbona &#128514<br>
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0VO8gYVDSwM1Qdd2GsMoYK?si=XRvufQB5S6CmkqwE_-a-Rw" target="_blank"><img src="moth.jpg" alt="Moth to a flame" width="200px"></a><br>
            I usually think about send it to you if you ever find someone else.. then I start feeling sad . Im a weird person &#128514<br>
            Then there's Love in the dark by Adele.. It reminds me of that time we weren't talking.. coz I was listening to it alot back then<br>
            she's actually my favorite female artist btw &#128514. I feel like we've hurt each other a lot. I just hope I make you feel loved more than i hurt you<br>
            But I won't focus on the sad stuff.. It's your birthday &#128514<br>
            wacha nisimention songs from our playlist &#128514 like soundgasm &#128527 <br> 
            but there's this song by H.E.R that makes me think of you..<span style="color: rgb(226, 34, 140);" >Best part </span>I don't know if you remember but it was the first song you told me to go listen to<br>
            I was asking you what was the best part about the first time we met.. we were at the Gazibo na you were refusing to tell me for some reason &#128514 I'd say I miss those times but you had a boyfriend so no.. I don't miss those times &#128514<br>
            I hate that you're going to finish going through all this in seconds na it took me days to prepare &#128557 &#128557 It's your fault for being a fast reader btw<br>
            Anyway.. I don't know what I'll do for the next page but <a href="Winnie.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to proceed.. might be the last page coz I'm running out of ideas &#128514
